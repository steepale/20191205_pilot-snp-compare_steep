# An Exploration of Germline SNPs Across Chicken Lines

High confidence germline variants were compared between 4 chicken lines (2 from Michigan and 2 from Arkansas)--Line 6, Line 7, Progressor, and Regressor--in an attempt at a 'birds-eye-view' of genotype distributions. The biological hypotheses guiding this pilot analysis were created by Beth Krehbiel and Harvey Blackburn, and the analysis was performed with the help of Alec Steep.  

## Information about Line 6 and Line 7
Line 6 and Line 7 were maintained at the Avian Disease and Oncology Lab in East Lansing, Michigan. They represent highly inbred lines that are resistant (Line 6) and susceptible (Line 7) to Marek's disease pathogensis, which is a lymphoproliferative disease driven by a herpesvirus. One might infer that these lines are resistant and susceptible to cancer in general. 

## Information about the Arkansas Progressor and Regressor Lines:
The Progressor line demonstrates infertility while the regressor line demonstrates fertility.
